## ğŸš€ About Me

Hi, I'm **Rohit** â€” a curious developer, problem-solver, and digital builder.

ğŸŒ± I'm a 2nd-year **BCA student at Kristu Jayanti College**, constantly learning and creating.

ğŸ’¡ I'm passionate about turning ideas into useful web products â€” from simple UI concepts to smart backend integrations.

ğŸ”§ I enjoy clean code, good coffee, and making tech that **feels easy** for users and fun for devs.

ğŸ’¬ I believe in building things that matter, and this project reflects my ability to **plan, execute, and ship** functional web products â€” independently.
